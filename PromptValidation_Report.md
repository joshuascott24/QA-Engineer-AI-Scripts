# AI Prompt Validation - Summary Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the validation of AI-generated prompts using automated techniques. The validation ensures clarity, relevance, length constraints, and bias detection.

## Issues Identified
- **3 prompts had unclear grammar** (failed the clarity check).
- **4 prompts contained flagged words** (e.g., "bias", "stereotype").
- **5 prompts did not align with their assigned category** (low relevance score).
- **2 prompts exceeded the max length limit (200 characters)**.
- **3 prompts had negative sentiment**, indicating possible unintended bias.

## AI Model Inconsistencies
- Some prompts were categorized under incorrect subjects, affecting relevance scores.
- Bias detection flagged unintended stereotypes, which require better prompt generation techniques.
- Several math-related prompts were marked under "Science" instead of "Math."

## Suggested Improvements
- **Enhance AI training data** to reduce misclassification of prompts into incorrect categories.
- **Use advanced NLP techniques** (like deep-learning models) for grammar checking instead of simple regex-based rules.
- **Expand flagged words list** to capture more subtle biases.
- **Fine-tune sentiment analysis thresholds** to improve detection accuracy.

## Retraining Recommendations (Bonus)
- **Introduce contextual embeddings** (e.g., BERT) to enhance topic alignment.
- **Use real-world exam questions** as training data to improve curriculum fidelity.
- **Regularly update flagged word lists** based on linguistic trends.

## Next Steps
1. Review and refine flagged prompts manually.
2. Implement additional validation rules for improved classification.
3. Conduct further AI model evaluations on different datasets.
